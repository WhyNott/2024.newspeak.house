Each person who uses the common space is expected to restore the environment back to how it was.

- All surfaces should be clean
- Put dishes in the dishwasher if unclean or hand wash them (don’t put wood or knives in the dishwasher)
- If you bring food, use the guest’s fridge (under the tea counter labelled guests) and put your name on it:
	- A Sharpie is available on the tea counter
	- Items without identifiable ownership will be up for grabs
	- Expired items will be thrown out
- Hand-dry big items if you use them (pots, bowls)
- Don’t leave rubbish in communal areas
- If you spill something, clean it up :)
