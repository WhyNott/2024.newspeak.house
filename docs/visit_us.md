> **The Newspeak Effect (n.)**
> 
> Definition: As the clock hits 12, you realise you have stayed on at Newspeak House longer than you planned, but you are still hooked by the scintillating conversation, contagious laughter, and dim-lit lights swirling altogether in the air. 

A key feature of Newspeak House is the numerous and diverse community members that visit this physical space for either co-working, brainstorming, or simply to socialise with others. 

Everyone has something to bring to the table, ranging from politics, technology, economics, philosophy, open-source magic, sleep science, comic arts, deep internet lore, and so much more.
